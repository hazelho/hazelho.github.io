		<h1>Hiya, welcome to Hazel's page!</h1>
		<img src="http://hazelho.com/hazel.jpg" alt="Hazel" />
		<p>I'm Hazel and I'm a student at Startup Institute Berlin's Web Design track.</p>
		<p>I'm a marketer with a passion for technology. I love the idea of being involved in creating usable websites and technologies for people so I am very excited to be taking this web design course.</p> 
		<p>Me in a nutshell: I'm originally from Canada but have been living in England for the last 3.5 years. I'm passionate about travel and if you give me food, you've got yourself a friend for life. Let's be clear here, I'm not a foodie - I just like food, all food, in large quantities.</p>
